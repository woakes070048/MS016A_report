\subsection*{Abstract}

\section{Introduction}

\subsubsection{Problem statement}

The given problem statement in this project was as follows:

\emph{Setup and evaluate and compare the perlbal and pound load balancers for a
web- service with regard to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Configureability
    \item Performance
    \item Scalability
\end{itemize}}

\section{Background}
Load balancers are important to most of the high end websites that are
available. Ensuring high availability and great scalability. They can be a part
of even the smallest sites that are prone to fail, but that need high uptime,
or to balance the load over multiple webservers, or database servers.

% Talk about httperf

% Talk about HAProxy

% Talk about Pound

\section{Approach}
% How thing is supposed to be set up
% Hypothesis

% assumption: set of assumption for the different cases
% how the setup is
% The different cases:
    % httperf with increasing rate of requests and/or connections
        % naturally that there are multiple requests per connection

\section{Result}
%What happened
% Subsection: Configurability
%   Syntax? Functions, documentation, community and continuous support (new
%   versions?) This is relevant, but not directly to how it works. Evaluate
%   this!
%


% the data are presented as described in the approach section
% how are the tests run
% sample output of scripts and/or httperf
% present the data for the spesifik sets
    % how to find the data and how they were analyzed


% ssl signing: openssl req -x509 -sha256 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:4096
% -keyout mycert.pem -out mycert.pem

\section{Analysis}
 %Look at the data
 % Analyze the hypothesis

\section{Discussion and conclusion}


\subsection{Improvements}
% SSL and why we dont care here. 
% Other possible benchmarking tools?

\subsection{Conclusion}
